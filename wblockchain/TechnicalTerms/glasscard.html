            <h2>1.Decentralization</h2>
            <p>It is main term related to  blockchain technology we should keep in mind.
                It refers to the distribution of authority, control, and decision-making across a network of nodes or participants rather than being concentrated in a single central authority or entity. It is a fundamental principle of blockchain systems. <b>Let's explain decentralization in the context of blockchain with a story example:
                Once upon a time, there was a town called Blockchainville. In Blockchainville, there was a central marketplace controlled by a single authority, Mayor Centralizer. All transactions and trades in the town had to go through Mayor Centralizer, who decided the rules, validated transactions, and had the power to change prices or reject trades at will. One day, the people of Blockchainville became dissatisfied with the central authority's control .They decided to create a new marketplace based on blockchain technology. They formed a network of computers called "nodes" and connected them together. In this new decentralized marketplace, there was no single central authority like Mayor Centralizer. Instead, all the nodes in the network had equal rights and responsibilities. Each node had a copy of the entire marketplace's records, known as the blockchain. Whenever someone wanted to make a transaction or trade, they would broadcast their request to all the nodes in the network. The nodes would then verify the transaction using a consensus mechanism, where they collectively agreed on the validity of the transaction and its place in the order of transactions.</b>

            <p>It is a cryptographic key that is publicly shared and used for various security operations, such as encryption, verification, and establishing secure communication channels. ECC algorithm is applied to the private key, to get a unique public key. This is the private public key pair.
