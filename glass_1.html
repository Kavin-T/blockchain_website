            <h2>1.Decentralization</h2>
            <p>It is main term related to  blockchain technology we should keep in mind.
                It refers to the distribution of authority, control, and decision-making across a network of nodes or participants rather than being concentrated in a single central authority or entity. It is a fundamental principle of blockchain systems. Let's explain decentralization in the context of blockchain with a story example:
                Once upon a time, there was a town called Blockchainville. In Blockchainville, there was a central marketplace controlled by a single authority, Mayor Centralizer. All transactions and trades in the town had to go through Mayor Centralizer, who decided the rules, validated transactions, and had the power to change prices or reject trades at will. One day, the people of Blockchainville became dissatisfied with the central authority's control .They decided to create a new marketplace based on blockchain technology. They formed a network of computers called "nodes" and connected them together. In this new decentralized marketplace, there was no single central authority like Mayor Centralizer. Instead, all the nodes in the network had equal rights and responsibilities. Each node had a copy of the entire marketplace's records, known as the blockchain. Whenever someone wanted to make a transaction or trade, they would broadcast their request to all the nodes in the network. The nodes would then verify the transaction using a consensus mechanism, where they collectively agreed on the validity of the transaction and its place in the order of transactions.

            <h2>2.Participants</h2>
            <p>Participants in a blockchain refer to the entities or individuals that are part of the blockchain network and actively engage in its operations. These participants play different roles and contribute to the functioning of the blockchain ecosystem. In a broad terms Miners,codewriter[Smart Contract] , Sender,Receivers play different roles and contribute to the functioning of the blockchain ecosystem.

            <p>It is a cryptographic key that is publicly shared and used for various security operations, such as encryption, verification, and establishing secure communication channels. ECC algorithm is applied to the private key, to get a unique public key. This is the private public key pair.

            <p>A digital wallet in blockchain refers to a software application or service that allows individuals to securely store, manage, and transact digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, using blockchain technology. It is essentially a digital equivalent of a physical wallet that holds traditional currency and cards.Public key, is a unique identifier associated with a user's digital wallet. The public address can be freely shared with others for receiving payments. The private key is a cryptographic code that serves as a digital signature and is used to access and authorize transactions from the wallet.</p>

            <p> A token refers to a digital representation of an asset or utility that is issued and tracked on a blockchain platform. Tokens are created and managed using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code on the blockchain.
