    <h1>1.1. WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?</h1>
</div>
<div class="parabc1">
    <p align="left" class="bcp"><b>Blockchain</b> is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes in a secure and transparent manner. It serves as a public database or ledger that maintains a growing list of records called blocks, which are linked together using cryptographic hashes to form a chain. In this all transaction details are sent to all the participants in the blockchain, it shows wide transparency.
     <img src="images/bc1pic1.svg" alt="" class="bc1pic1">
         Here you can thought our transaction detail visible to all, then how it could be secure the answer is that our transaction ID only visible to all participants. Here transaction id meant public key and account address through this our privacy gets protected. There is also a Private key which is a pair of public key, through private key we can transfer money to other in a secure manner, the private key kept secure by the sender. Private keys can be further protected by encrypting them with a passphrase, also known as a password or passphrase encryption. When a passphrase is used, it adds an additional layer of security to the private key, making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access and use it. More concepts about "keys" will be in "HOW BLOCKCHAIN WORKS" module.

            <h1>1.3 BEYOND BITCOIN</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="parabc1">
            <p align="left" class="bcp">Let's now look beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin blockchain is open-source and the entire code is
                available on the GitHub. During the initial years beginning roughly in 2009, this open-source
                code was extended to release different cryptocurrencies. About 300 plus cryptocurrencies were
                introduced. Bitcoin supports an optional and special feature called scripts for conditional transfer
                of values.Ethereum Blockchain expanded the scripting feature and created a powerful code
                execution framework called smart contract. A smart contract provide the very powerful capability
                of code execution for embedding business logic on the blockchain. Based on such capabilities,
                three major types of blockchains emerge from Bitcoin foundation. Type one deals with the coins
                in cryptocurrency currency chain. Example, Bitcoin.                       
            <img src="undraw_crypto_flowers_re_dyqo.svg" alt="" class="bc1pic1">
                Type two supports cryptocurrency and a business logic layer supported by code execution. Example, ethereum. Type three involves no
                currency but supports software execution for business logic. Example, The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger. With the addition of code execution, comes the serious consideration about public
                access to the blockchain hence, the classification of public, private, and permissioned
                blockchains based on access limits. We have been watching Bitcoin blockchain continuously
                operational since its inception. All supported by its public participants. Thus Bitcoin is a fantastic
                example of a public blockchain class. Anybody can join and leave as they wish. Transaction
                blocks and the blockchain are publicly observable even though participants are anonymous. It is
                open-source. You can also create new coin digital currency by modifying the Bitcoin code.
                Wallet applications provide the basic interface to transfer value through the Bitcoin blockchain.

            <h1>1.4 WALLET APPLICATON</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="parabc1">
            <p align="left" class="bcp"><b>Wallet applications serve as a user-friendly platform or interface that allows individuals to send
                and receive transactions involving Bitcoin.</b> In a private blockchain, access to the blockchain is limited to selected participants for example,
                those participants within an organization. This restriction helps in simplifying the normal
                operations such as block creation and contingence model. The third classification of blockchain
                is permissioned blockchain, also called consortium blockchain.    
            <img src="undraw_plain_credit_card_re_c07w.svg" alt="" class="bc1pic1">
                It is meant for a consortium of collaborating parties to transact on a blockchain for ease of governance, provenance, and
                accountability for example, a consortium of all automobile companies or healthcare
                organizations. Permissioned blockchain has the benefits of a public blockchain with allowing
                only users with permission to collaborate and transact. In summary, significant innovations such
                as smart contracts have opened up broader applications for blockchain technology. Private and
                permissioned blockchain allow for controlled access to the blockchain enabling many diverse
                business models.
