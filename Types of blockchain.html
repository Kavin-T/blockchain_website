          <p class="bcp">Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Public blockchains are maintained by a distributed
network of nodes, and their data is transparent and accessible to anyone. Any one can join the
network and leave as they wish. The first cryptocurrency Bitcoin uses the public chain which is
also a reason for its recognition. but they may also face challenges like scalability and
transaction speed due to the need for consensus among a large number of participants</p>

           <p class="bcp"> The security of a public blockchain primarily based on the consensus mechanism, which
                ensures that the majority of participants agree on the validity of transactions and the order in
                which they are added to the blockchain. This consensus are the agreement or protocol that
                agreed by the participants in the chain. The consensus mechanism can be based on proof of
                work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), or other algorithms [ we covered this topics under Technical
                Terms section ]. As far now please consider that bitcoin uses PoW ,ethereum uses PoS and
                these algorithms are used to solve some complex problems as a result they get HASH value. </p>

              <p class="bcp"><b>Characteristics and advantages of private blockchains:</b><br></br>
                <b>1. Permissioned Access:</b> These blockchains are typically used within organizations. This allows
                organizations to maintain control over who can participate, ensuring that only trusted person are
                involved in the network.<br></br>
                <b>2. Enhanced Privacy:</b> Private blockchains offer greater privacy and confidentiality compared to
                public blockchains. Transaction details and data are shared only among the approved
                participants.<br></br>
                <b>3. Higher Scalability:</b> Since private blockchains operate within a restricted network, they
                typically exhibit better scalability compared to public blockchains. With fewer participants and
                transactions to process, private blockchains can achieve higher transaction and faster validation
                times.<br></br>
                <b>4. Cost Efficiency:</b> Private blockchains can offer cost advantages in terms of transaction fees
                and energy consumption compared to public blockchains. Since private blockchains do not rely
                on mining and the associated energy-intensive processes, they can be more energy-efficient
                and have lower transaction costs. In simple terms, it does not use PoW which requires high
                energy instead they use any other low energy consuming algorithms since only small quantity of
                people is there as compare to Public blockchain.
