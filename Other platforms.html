        Ethereum's most notable feature is its support for smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. This allows for decentralized applications (DApps) to be built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum has faced challenges with scalability, as the network can become congested during times of high usage. However, several scalability solutions are being developed, including sharding and layer-two solutions like Plasma and Rollups, to increase the network's capacity and reduce transaction costs.
