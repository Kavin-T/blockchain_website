            <p>A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared and synchronized across multiple participants or nodes in a network. 
                It provides a decentralized and transparent way to record, store, and update data in a distributed manner.<br>

                the genesis block created by the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, on January 3, 2009.<br>

            <h2>3. Forks</h2>
            <p>In a blockchain technology, a fork refers to a divergence or split in the protocol of a blockchain network. It occurs when there is a fundamental 
                change in the rules or consensus mechanism of the blockchain. There are two forks namely hard and soft forks.<br>

            <h2>4. Hard forks</h2>
            <p>A hard fork is a permanent divergence in the blockchain where nodes following the old protocol are no longer compatible with the new version. It involves a significant change to the underlying protocol, 
                often introducing new features, rules, or consensus mechanisms. After a hard fork occurs, the blockchain splits into two separate chains, and each chain continues to operate 
                independently with its own set of rules. Participants in the network must upgrade their software to the new version to continue participating in the new chain.<br>

            <h2>5.Soft Fork</h2>
            <p>A soft fork is a backward-compatible upgrade to the blockchain protocol. It involves introducing new rules or features that 
                are within the scope of the existing protocol. Nodes running the old software can still participate in the network, but they 
                may not be able to take advantage of the new features or fully validate the new types of transactions. The soft fork typically 
                involves tightening or restricting the rules rather than introducing major changes. Transactions and blocks 
                following the new rules are still recognized by the older nodes, ensuring compatibility and maintaining a single chain.<br>

                  for another or for traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or euro. It's important to research and choose
                 a reputable and well-established cryptocurrency exchange that meets your specific trading needs.<br>

                 to operate without the need for a central authority, allowing for transparency, security, and trust among participants.
                  DApps often rely on smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into 
                  code. Smart contracts enable automated and trustless interactions between participants, 
                ensuring that transactions are executed according to predetermined rules without the need for intermediaries.<br>

                contract-oriented language that allows developers to write code to create and execute 
                smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It enables developers to create

                 ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, typically 
                 on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and interchangeable,
                 each NFT has a distinct value and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.<br>

            <h2>10. Oracles</h2>
            <p>An oracle is a mechanism or service that provides external data to the blockchain network or smart contract. 
                Oracles act as bridges between the blockchain and the real world, enabling smart contracts to interact with and
                 make decisions based on data or events that are not directly available on the blockchain. For examples it is used in
                 <br>Sports Betting :<br>
                Oracles can be used in decentralized sports betting platforms to provide real-time scores and outcomes of sporting events.
                 Smart contracts rely on oracles to settle bets and distribute winnings based on the verified results. SportCrypt is an 
                 example of a decentralized sports betting platform that uses oracles.

                 It provides a user-friendly interface and serves as a bridge between web browsers and the Ethereum blockchain. 
                 It enables users to store, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and other ERC-20 tokens. It injects a JavaScript library
